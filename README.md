# ML--All-classification-algorithms
Using all classification algorithms and performing the imbalance technique .

1)ada boost
2)Random forest
3)Logistic regression
4)XGB

built with these four algorithms.
checking the which can give the better accuracy between them for selection one technique.
But classification problems not give the good accuracy as we expect.
